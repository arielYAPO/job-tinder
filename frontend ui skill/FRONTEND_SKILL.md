# JobTinder UI Skill (Neon MVP)

## Identity
A Tinder-style job app with a bold neon/night aesthetic.
This is not a corporate dashboard.
It should feel like a premium, modern consumer app.

## Core Aesthetic
- Dark + neon + glass
- Energetic but controlled
- High contrast, sharp hierarchy
- Romantic tech vibe (JobTinder)

## Visual Rules
- Use 1 primary accent + 1 secondary accent.
- Use glow only for:
  (a) primary CTA,
  (b) active state,
  (c) highlight badge.
- Prefer gradient borders over heavy full-surface gradients.
- Glass surfaces should be subtle and readable.

## Typography
- Strong headline font + clean body font.
- Tight scale:
  H1 28-32
  H2 20-24
  Body 14-16
  Label 12-13
- Increase letter-spacing slightly on labels/badges.

## Layout & Components
- Cards are the hero.
- Use depth:
  background -> haze -> glass card -> neon edge
- Buttons must be tactile:
  hover + press + glow pulse.

## Motion
- Swipes should be:
  - smooth
  - slightly elastic
  - with micro-particle or glow trail (lightweight)

## Don't
- Don't drift into “AI SaaS template”.
- Don't use generic rounded pastel UI.
- Don't add 5+ accent colors.
- Don't overuse neon glows everywhere.
